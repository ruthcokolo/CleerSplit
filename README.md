# CleerSplit

CleerSplit is a full-stack iOS application for managing shared expenses among friends, roommates, families, and teams. The app focuses on clarity, transparency, and reducing friction around group finances through a clean, intuitive user experience.

This project is being built end-to-end as a real product, covering design, frontend engineering, backend services, testing, and deployment.
